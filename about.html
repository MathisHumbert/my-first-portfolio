        <h3>french winemaker trying to become a front end developer</h3>
        <p>
         I was born in 1998 in Mâcon, France. I was raised in a little town called Fuissé.
         This village is surronded by vines.
        </p>
        <p>Since I'm a kid I'm very  interested in computer and video game. By the age of 5 years old I had my first own computer, an old computer that my grand parent gave me.
         Since this time I spend a lot of times on these machines. </p>
        <p>
         Before studying winemaking I was in Law School for 2 years. I  decided to become a winemaker because Law School was boring for me and because I was raised in this village and I used to work for winegrower and winemaker.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have long hesiated to study computer science but I never dared to start my study again. So today I'm learning web development online and by my own.
